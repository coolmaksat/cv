However, these methods usually require a significant amount of training data and cannot make predictions for GO classes that have only few or no experimental annotations.We developed DeepGOZero, a machine learning model which improves predictions for functions with no or only a small number of annotations. To achieve this goal, we rely on a model-theoretic approach for learning ontology embeddings and combine it with neural networks for protein function prediction. DeepGOZero can exploit formal axioms in the GO to make zero-shot predictions, i.e., predict protein functions even if not a single protein in the training phase was associated with that function. Furthermore, the zero-shot prediction method employed by DeepGOZero is generic and can be applied whenever associations with ontology classes need to be predicted.http://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/deepgozero.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

We developed DeepPheno, a novel approach for predicting the phenotypes resulting from a loss of function of a single gene. We use gene functions and gene expression as information to prediction phenotypes. Our method uses a neural network classifier that is able to account for hierarchical dependencies between phenotypes. We extensively evaluate our method and compare it with related approaches, and we show that DeepPheno results in better performance in several evaluations. Furthermore, we found that many of the new predictions made by our method have been added to phenotype association databases released one year later. Overall, DeepPheno simulates some aspects of human physiology and how molecular and physiological alterations lead to abnormal phenotypes.},

Many methods are available for predicting protein functions from sequence based features, protein–protein interaction networks, protein structure or literature. However, other than sequence, most of the features are difficult to obtain or not available for many proteins thereby limiting their scope. Furthermore, the performance of sequence-based function prediction methods is often lower than methods that incorporate multiple features and predicting protein functions may require a lot of time.We developed a novel method for predicting protein functions from sequence alone which combines deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model with sequence similarity based predictions. Our CNN model scans the sequence for motifs which are predictive for protein functions and combines this with functions of similar proteins (if available). We evaluate the performance of DeepGOPlus using the CAFA3 evaluation measures and achieve an Fmax of 0.390, 0.557 and 0.614 for BPO, MFO and CCO evaluations, respectively. These results would have made DeepGOPlus one of the three best predictors in CCO and the second best performing method in the BPO and MFO evaluations. We also compare DeepGOPlus with state-of-the-art methods such as DeepText2GO and GOLabeler on another dataset. DeepGOPlus can annotate around 40 protein sequences per second on common hardware, thereby making fast and accurate function predictions available for a wide range of proteins.http://deepgoplus.bio2vec.net/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

This can help clinicians arrive at a diagnosis, but also can be instrumental in improving our understanding of the pathobiology of the disease. Many methods are currently available to help with the problem of determining causative variant, using information about evolutionary conservation and prediction of the functional consequences of the sequence variant. We have developed a novel algorithm (PVP) which augments existing strategies by using the similarity of the patients phenotype to known phenotype-genotype data in human and model organism databases to further rank potential candidate genes. In a retrospective study, we apply PVP to the interpretation of whole exome sequencing data in patients suffering from congenital hypothyroidism, and find that PVP accurately identifies causative variants in whole exome and whole genome sequencing datasets and provides a powerful resource for the discovery of causal variants.},

abstract={An increasing number of disorders have been identified for which two or more distinct alleles in two or more genes are required to either cause the disease or to significantly modify its onset, severity or phenotype. It is difficult to discover such interactions using existing approaches. The purpose of our work is to develop and evaluate a system that can identify combinations of alleles underlying digenic and oligogenic diseases in individual whole exome or whole genome sequences. Information that links patient phenotypes to databases of gene--phenotype associations observed in clinical or non-human model organism research can provide useful information and improve variant prioritization for genetic diseases. Additional background knowledge about interactions between genes can be utilized to identify sets of variants in different genes in the same individual which may then contribute to the overall disease phenotype. We have developed OligoPVP, an algorithm that can be used to prioritize causative combinations of variants in digenic and oligogenic diseases, using whole exome or whole genome sequences together with patient phenotypes as input. We demonstrate that OligoPVP has significantly improved performance when compared to state of the art pathogenicity detection methods in the case of digenic diseases. Our results show that OligoPVP can efficiently prioritize sets of variants in digenic diseases using a phenotype-driven approach and identify etiologically important variants in whole genomes. OligoPVP naturally extends to oligogenic disease involving interactions between variants in two or more genes. It can be applied to the identification of multiple interacting candidate variants contributing to phenotype, where the action of modifier genes is suspected from pedigree analysis or failure of traditional causative variant identification.},

   abstract = "Contemporary metagenomic annotation methods have proven insufficient in our attempts to better understand the complex environments around us. We call the yet to be annotated part of a metagenome it’s ‘dark matter’. The Gene Ontology (GO) is a hierarchical vocabulary used to describe gene product function and a large collection of curated genes with GO annotations already exists. DeepGO utilises deep learning to build models from these curated genes and gene products to predict GO categories for novel proteins. One of the major problems with metagenomic studies today is the process of assembling the environmental DNA sequences into their original genomes. This is difficult, with chimeric metagenomically assembled genomes being common. To avoid this and the computational and time expense, we have modified DeepGO to perform protein function prediction directly from sequence reads with limited protein coding sequence prediction. Three independent models were trained as the following; The first 50 amino acids of a protein were used for training, The last 50 amino acids were used for training, A phasing window of 50 amino acids was used to train across the entirety of a protein sequence. These models were chosen to learn from the different parts of a protein sequence we are likely to capture from only the short unassembled sequence reads. We compared the three models by producing a mock metagenomic community consisting of 6 model bacterial genomes. We evaluated the functions predicted from the unassembled sequence reads and the protein coding sequences predicted from the assembled metagenome.",

    abstract = "{Ontologies have long been employed in the life sciences to formally represent and reason over domain knowledge and they are employed in almost every major biological database. Recently, ontologies are increasingly being used to provide background knowledge in similarity-based analysis and machine learning models. The methods employed to combine ontologies and machine learning are still novel and actively being developed. We provide an overview over the methods that use ontologies to compute similarity and incorporate them in machine learning methods; in particular, we outline how semantic similarity measures and ontology embeddings can exploit the background knowledge in ontologies and how ontologies can provide constraints that improve machine learning models. The methods and experiments we describe are available as a set of executable notebooks, and we also provide a set of slides and additional resources at https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/machine-learning-with-ontologies.}",
